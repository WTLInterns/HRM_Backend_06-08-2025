# Device Mapping Test Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated PowerShell Test (Recommended)
```powershell
cd hrm_backend
.\test-device-mapping.ps1
```

### Option 2: Quick Batch Test
```cmd
cd hrm_backend
quick-test.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual API Testing (Step by Step)

## üìã Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Status
```bash
curl https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/subadmin/1/status
```

**Look for:**
- `totalEmployees`: Number of employees
- `totalMappings`: Number of device mappings
- `mappingCoverage`: Should be "X/X" (all employees mapped)

### Step 2: Fix Existing Issues (if any)
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/subadmin/1/fix-mappings
```

### Step 3: Add New Employee via API
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.managifyhr.com/api/subadmin/1/add-employee \
  -F "firstName=TestMapping" \
  -F "lastName=Employee" \
  -F "email=testmapping@example.com" \
  -F "phone=9876543210" \
  -F "address=Test Address" \
  -F "position=Test Position" \
  -F "department=Test Department" \
  -F "salary=50000"
```

### Step 4: Check Status After Adding
```bash
curl https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/subadmin/1/status
```

**Verify:**
- `totalEmployees` increased by 1
- `totalMappings` also increased by 1
- `mappingCoverage` still shows "X/X" (perfect coverage)

### Step 5: Check Individual Employee
```bash
# Replace 505 with the actual employee ID from step 3
curl https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/employee/505/status
```

**Verify:**
- `deviceSerialNumber` is set
- `mappingCount` is 1
- `deviceSerialMatch` is true

## üéØ Expected Results

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS Indicators:
```json
{
  "totalEmployees": 4,
  "totalMappings": 4,
  "summary": {
    "mappingCoverage": "4/4"
  }
}
```

### ‚ùå FAILURE Indicators:
```json
{
  "totalEmployees": 4,
  "totalMappings": 3,  // ‚ùå Missing mapping
  "summary": {
    "mappingCoverage": "3/4"  // ‚ùå Not all mapped
  }
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Device Serial Number
```bash
# Check if subadmin has device serial assigned
curl https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/subadmin/1/status
```
Look for: `"hasDeviceSerial": false`

**Solution:** Assign device serial in master admin panel

### Issue: Mappings Not Created
```bash
# Force create mappings
curl -X POST https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/subadmin/1/fix-mappings
```

### Issue: Individual Employee Missing Mapping
```bash
# Create mapping for specific employee
curl -X POST https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/employee/504/create-mapping
```

## üìä Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh System
1. Check status (should show some unmapped employees)
2. Run fix-mappings
3. Add new employee
4. Verify all employees mapped

### Scenario 2: Existing System
1. Check current coverage
2. Add new employee
3. Verify coverage maintained
4. Update existing employee
5. Verify mappings preserved

### Scenario 3: Problem Recovery
1. Identify missing mappings
2. Run fix-mappings
3. Verify all fixed
4. Test adding new employee

## üîç Debug Endpoints

### Get All Mappings for Device
```bash
curl https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/device/DEVICE001/mappings
```

### Get Subadmin Status
```bash
curl https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/subadmin/1/status
```

### Get Employee Status
```bash
curl https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/employee/504/status
```

### Fix All Mappings
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/subadmin/1/fix-mappings
```

### Create Individual Mapping
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.managifyhr.com/api/debug/device-mapping/employee/504/create-mapping
```

## üìù Test Checklist

- [ ] Backend is running on port 8282
- [ ] Subadmin has device serial number assigned
- [ ] Initial status check shows current state
- [ ] Fix-mappings resolves any existing issues
- [ ] Adding employee preserves existing mappings
- [ ] New employee gets device serial automatically
- [ ] New employee gets device mapping automatically
- [ ] Final coverage is 100% (X/X)
- [ ] Individual employee check shows proper mapping
- [ ] Update employee doesn't break mappings

## üéâ Success Criteria

**The fix is working if:**
1. ‚úÖ Adding new employee increases both employee count AND mapping count
2. ‚úÖ Existing employees keep their mappings when new ones are added
3. ‚úÖ New employees automatically get device serial number
4. ‚úÖ New employees automatically get device mapping
5. ‚úÖ Coverage remains at 100% (X/X) after operations
6. ‚úÖ No manual reassignment needed in admin panel
